== Neo4j Streams Consumer

Is the Kafka Sink that ingest the data directly into Neo4j

=== How it works

It works with template Cypher queries stored into properties with the following format:

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.<TOPIC_NAME>=<CYPHER_QUERY>
----

Each Cypher template must refer to an *event* object that will be injected by the Sink

Following an example:

For this event

[source,javascript]
----
{
 "id": 42,
 "properties": {
 "title": "Answer to anyting",
 "description": "It depends."}
}
----

.neo4j.conf
[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.my-topic=MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id}) \
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----

Under the hood the Sink inject the event object as a parameter in this way

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND {events} AS event
MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id})
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----

Where {batch} is a json list, so continuing with the example above a possible full representation could be:

[source,cypher]
----
:params events => [{id:"alice@example.com",properties:{name:"Alice",age:32}},
    {id:"bob@example.com",properties:{name:"Bob",age:42}}]

UNWIND {events} AS event
MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id})
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----
